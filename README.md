SpringRestProj01_TestingPostMan is the first RESTfull website i have ever developed and in that i have developed only get method of request because i just want to test by browser and by postman to check postman.
Later i have developed the SpringRestProj02_TestingAllMethods just to check postman's response of all the 5 methods.
And in the third commit you will find some student-api developed with RESTfull webservices for checking JSON(global) formatted data
